# BUAA: Microprocessors and Interfaces
Course projects for the course Microprocessors and Interfaces at Beihang University
This projects are all using assembly lauguage and are based on x86 8086 microprocessor.

## This labwork consists of 5 parts:

1. Add two integers
    * Add two 4-digit decimals from keyboard input and display the result on PC
    * Improve the program to accomodate add of unlimited digits decimals

2. Sorting
	* Sort alplabets from keyboard input (according to ASCII code)
    * Display sorted result on PC
    * Improved using bubblesort and quicksort algorithm

3. Digital Tubes
    * Display hex numbers on a digital tube
    * Implement with an Intel 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI) chip

4. D/A Convert
    * Output sine-wave and square-wave
    * Implement with an DAC0832 Double-Buffered D to A Converter

5. A/D Convert
    * Measure analog input value and displa the result on PC
    * Implement with an ADC0809 A to D Converter
